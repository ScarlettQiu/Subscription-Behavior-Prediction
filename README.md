# Subscription-Behavior-Prediction
The methods used in this repository involve Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines.
The purpose is to create a predictive model for a magazine company to predict the subscription behaviors and find the reason why its subscription has declined last year. By observing models created in this report, I have analyzed how the variables will influence the subscription decision of target audiences. Based on the analysis, I also provided suggestions on how to improve the subscription in the future.

# Dataset  
The dataset used is about the information of the customers including their demographic details, historical purchase behaviors, engagements with the company, campaign activities and whether they had a response in subscription.   
There are 2240 observations and 29 variables in this original dataset.   
15 of the variables are discrete variables, 11 of them are categorical variables and 3 of them are the continuous variable.
